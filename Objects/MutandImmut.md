# **Mutable And Immutability in JS**
## **Mutability**
>Mutability means that the value of a viriable can be changed after its been declared and assigned with a value. In other words, the value of a variable can be modified after it has been created .
<br>
### **Example of Mutability in JS**
```JS
let x = 10;
x = 20;

```
><span style=color:Yellow >NOTE: <span style= color:white>*To make the variable immutable, we can use the const keyword instead of let.*

``` JS
    const x = 100;
    x = 200

    //TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```
